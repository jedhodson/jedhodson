## Hey there üëã,
Welcome to my GitHub :octocat:. I'm just another human on üåè

### üî® Hardware + üíª Software = ü§ñ Cool stuff

I like to build things or pieces of things at the very least. Be it a electronics, software or both, this GitHub account will show some of what I do. 

**@todo**: Put more actual content here. But for now, enjoy the internets favourite placeholder text

Donec gravida fermentum arcu ac laoreet. Donec vel efficitur quam. Curabitur ac sodales diam, sed ullamcorper justo. Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus. Sed et risus ex. 

## ‚ö° Other places I exist

### Scatter Labs
[Scatter Labs](scatterlabs.com.au) is an itsy-bitsy engineering company working on bringing dreams and ideas to reality. Be it a device to help the masses or a thingamajig just for fun, we can help research, design, build and manufacture it. Its a way to keep busy and work on cool things.

### Prototyping Corner
Just a bunch of prototypes. Over at [prototypingcorner.io](prototypingcorner.io) you'll find the latest thingamajig that I've built and if I wasn't too lazy maybe event a writeup on how I did it. Its an assortment of things from dataloggers to localization systems, drones to robots that roll. If the thingamajig got a little polish it finds its way into the [Tindie Store](https://www.tindie.com/stores/prototyping-corner/) for all to enjoy - oh and everything there is completly [open source]().
